Passionate about programming and driven to excel as a full-stack/back-end PHP developer, I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences to the table. Previously, I dedicated several years of my life to playing rugby for Team Latvia, where I learned the importance of teamwork and perseverance. Additionally, I worked and gained valuable experience in software development, building and testing web pages.

Now fully focused on my programming career, I possess expertise in MVC architecture and the Laravel framework, empowering me to create robust and scalable web applications. With a solid foundation in PHP, I adeptly leverage my problem-solving skills to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-quality solutions.

I am committed to continuous growth and staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies. My passion for learning has led me to explore the field of software engineering, further enhancing my skills. I am genuinely excited to apply my knowledge and drive to contribute to the success of forward-thinking organizations.

If you're searching for a determined professional who excels in team environments, I invite you to reach out. Let's connect and explore how we can achieve remarkable outcomes together.
My last three projects:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/purvinsg/CryptoBank_v2">Simple Bank & Crypto Exchange Page</a>: I developed an engaging website that simulates a bank and crypto exchange, allowing users to effortlessly create accounts, make money transfers, and buy crypto assets.
The website is built using the Laravel framework, with the backend powered by PHP and the frontend utilizing Vue.js. Data is securely stored in a MySQL database, and the page incorporates two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security. </li>
  
  <li><a href="https://github.com/purvinsg/RickMortyv1">Rick and Morty Website</a>: I created a website for browsing characters, locations, and episodes from the TV show, Rick and Morty. The site integrates with an API, offers a character filter, and follows the MVC architecture. It utilizes Twig for rendering and Tailwind for styling, providing an immersive user experience.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/purvinsg/NewsFeed">News Site</a>: I developed a dynamic News Feed webpage using the JSONPlaceholder API and implemented cache systems for improved performance. The project adheres to the MVC architecture and includes a console application for filtering articles and users, ensuring a seamless user experience.</li>
  </ul>
