Passionate about programming and driven to excel as a full-stack/back-end PHP developer, I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences to the table. Previously, I dedicated several years of my life to playing rugby for Team Latvia, where I learned the importance of teamwork and perseverance. Additionally, I worked and gained valuable experience in software development, building and testing web pages.

Now fully focused on my programming career, I possess expertise in MVC architecture and the Laravel framework, empowering me to create robust and scalable web applications. With a solid foundation in PHP, I adeptly leverage my problem-solving skills to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-quality solutions.

I am committed to continuous growth and staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies. My passion for learning has led me to explore the field of software engineering, further enhancing my skills. I am genuinely excited to apply my knowledge and drive to contribute to the success of forward-thinking organizations.

If you're searching for a determined professional who excels in team environments, I invite you to reach out. Let's connect and explore how we can achieve remarkable outcomes together.
My last three projects:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/purvinsg/RickMortyv1"”>Rick and Morty</a>: I developed a captivating website that allows users to effortlessly browse characters, locations, and episodes from the popular TV show, Rick and Morty. The website seamlessly integrates with an API and offers a convenient character filter functionality, enabling users to easily find specific characters of interest.

The website's architecture adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, ensuring a well-structured and maintainable codebase. Leveraging the power of routing, users can navigate through different sections of the website with ease. To enhance performance and optimize data retrieval, I implemented a robust cache system, enabling faster and more efficient access to the content.

For the presentation layer, I utilized Twig as the template engine, allowing for dynamic and customizable rendering of the website's components. Additionally, Tailwind was employed for styling, providing a sleek and visually appealing user interface.

By undertaking this project, I gained valuable experience in API integration, implementing MVC architecture, developing efficient routing systems, and leveraging cache mechanisms. The utilization of Twig and Tailwind underscores my commitment to delivering a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing browsing experience for Rick and Morty enthusiasts.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/purvinsg/NewsFeed">News Site</a>: In this project, I created a dynamic News Feed webpage by harnessing the power of the JSONPlaceholder API and integrating a placeholder image service. The webpage was meticulously designed following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring an organized structure and efficient data management. To enhance performance, I implemented cache systems, services, and repositories.
To provide a seamless user experience, I developed a console application that allows users to easily filter articles and users. This console application also serves as a testing platform, enabling comprehensive testing procedures to ensure the reliability and functionality of the application.
By undertaking this project, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in API integration, proficiently manipulating data, and constructing dynamic webpages. The successful implementation of the MVC architecture, coupled with robust testing capabilities, attests to my dedication in creating well-structured, maintainable, and thoroughly tested applications. </li>
  </ul>
